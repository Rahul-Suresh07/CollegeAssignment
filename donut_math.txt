The math involved in the 3D rotating donut animation is based on:

1. *Trigonometry*: Sine and cosine functions are used to generate 3D coordinates of the torus (donut shape).
2. *3D Projection*: Perspective projection is used to map 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates.
3. *Rotation Matrices*: Rotation matrices are used to rotate the 3D coordinates of the torus.

*Rotation Matrices:*

A rotation matrix is a mathematical representation of a rotation in 3D space. It's a 3x3 matrix that, when multiplied with a 3D vector, rotates the vector around a specific axis.

There are three basic rotation matrices:

1. *Rotation around X-axis*:
| 1  0    0    |
| 0  cos -sin |
| 0  sin  cos |

2. *Rotation around Y-axis*:
| cos  0  sin |
| 0   1   0   |
| -sin 0  cos |

3. *Rotation around Z-axis*:
| cos -sin  0 |
| sin  cos  0 |
| 0    0    1 |

These matrices can be combined to rotate an object around multiple axes.

In the donut code, the rotation matrices are applied to the 3D coordinates of the torus to create the rotation effect.

*3D Projection:*

The 3D projection formula used in the code is a simplified version of the perspective projection formula:
x' = x / (z + distance)
y' = y / (z + distance)

This formula maps 3D coordinates (x, y, z) to 2D screen coordinates (x', y').

The code uses a combination of these mathematical concepts to create the rotating donut animation.
